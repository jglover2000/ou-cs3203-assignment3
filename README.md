Assignment #3 for Software Engineering

Assignment Details:

1. Create a software program (in any language you wish) which contains a function / method which
computes the sum of a list / array of numbers (integers, whatever you want) given as a parameter and
returns the result. Commit the result.

2. Extend the software program to add a function / method which computes the product (multiplication)
of all of a list / array of numbers given as a parameter and returns the result. Commit the result.

3. Extend the software program again to add a main method (or whatever equivalent in your programming
language of choice is) which allows a user to enter numbers and then calls both of the functions/methods
above and prints the result from each one (the sum and product of the numbers). Commit the result. Push all three commits to the Github repository.

4. Take a screenshot of the Insights Network graph and include this screenshot in the document submitted
as your solution to this assignment along with a label / caption stating this is for part 4 of the
assignment and shows three commits.

5. Create a new branch (e.g., named part5) on the HEAD of the default branch (e.g., main). In your
code, add a new function / method which takes a list / array of numbers and returns a list / array of
numbers which are the same numbers given as the argument to the function / method but in reverse
order. Commit the result on your new branch.

6. Add to your main method / function from part 3 above calling this new reversing function / method
with the user-entered numbers and print the result (along with printing the sum and product from
before). Commit the result on your new branch (which should now be two commits ”ahead” of the
main branch). Push to Github.

7. Take a screenshot of the Insights Network graph and include this screenshot in the document submitted
as your solution to this assignment along with a label / caption stating this is for part 7 of the
assignment and shows three commits on main and two additional commits on part5.

8. Merge your new branch to the main branch (not as a fast-forward commit). This should create a new
”merge commit” on the main branch which has two ”parent” commits. Push to Github.

9. Take a screenshot of the Insights Network graph and include this screenshot in the document submitted
as your solution to this assignment.

10. Checkout the third commit (from part 3 above) of the main branch, create a new branch (e.g., named
part10). Make any change to your code (e.g., reformat some lines of code, add some comments,
whatever) and commit the result on the new branch. Push to Github.

11. Take a screenshot of the Insights Network graph and include this screenshot in the document submitted
as your solution to this assignment along with a label / caption stating this is for part 11 of the
assignment and shows new branch part10.

12. Rebase your new branch to the HEAD of the main branch. Push to Github.

13. Take a screenshot of the Insights Network graph and include this screenshot in the document submitted
as your solution to this assignment along with a label / caption stating this is for part 13 of the assignment and shows branch part10 rebased to the HEAD of main.
